#+title: Purple

Personal data tracking tool written in Elixir with Phoenix
LiveView. This project for personal use, nothing is intended
to be useful for other parties :) .

* Features

+ Create boards, items, entries, and checkboxes
+ Drag n' drop items between ~TODO~, ~DONE~, and ~INFO~ statuses.
+ Upload any kind of file, view images, movies, and PDFs in-app.
+ Custom markdown dialect that dynamically renders other purple resources
+ Automatically import and organize credit card transactions
+ Renders live weather data from my home - publicly available at
  https://mypurplewebsite.com
+ And lots of other random stuff that I thought would be fun to implement

* Starting the Server

Running ~make~ will install dependencies, create the database, and run
pending migrations.

To start the server, run ~mix phx.server~
